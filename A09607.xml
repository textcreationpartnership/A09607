            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Moſt certaine it is faire creature, thy love may make me to ſacrifice my life at thy feet, and I may puniſh that body, which could ſo unjuſtly wound my once free and ſerene mind: but alas wherein canſt thou glory? not in thy beauty, for that will vaile it ſelfe at ſo blacke an Act; not in my ruines, for they will purſue thee with ſome direfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge: bluſh then thou faire one, ſince to be coy is to be cruell, to be cruell, is to alter the property of what thou yet art, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull.</p>

               <p>I cannot expreſſe the leaſt diſobedience to your commands, but rather hope my paſt diſpleaſures may deſerve pity, if not my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſervices a reward.</p>
               <p>Ponder my merits in the balance of your mercie, that the unworthineſſe of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts by the fair ſufferance of your goodneſſe may procure your gracious reſpects in my behalfe.</p>
               <p>It is a ſinne to ſuſpect ſuch vertue which glories to arme it ſelfe againſt all deceits.</p>
               <p>Faire one, you have a wit which delights not to judge it ſelfe, and a beauty that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to condemne others; reconcile your beauty to your wit, that the uſe of the one may reſtraine the abuſe of the other, whileſt we your ſervants live to admire your perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and you your ſelfe ſurvive to perfit your vertues.</p>
               <p>Faire one, what unremoveable ſuiter ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſes your affection from ſhining on your devoted and moſt conſtant ſervant?</p>

               <p>That my deſires to injoy you are more

               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> The eyes of a raviſhed Lover cannot but have vertues aid ſo ready in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as alwayes to bewaile the loſſe of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous conſtancy in others, ſince ſuch a loſſe by his owne affections is ever placed in the very face of his memory.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> It is a degree above humanity and therefore requires the admiration of your friends that your wit ſhould ſo far out-goe your age.</p>

               <p>It is you, and none but you which I am bound to love, and therefore though I am preſented with a likenes of your beauty, yet likeneſſe of another, cannot make the ſame eſſence of your perſon, much leſſe can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve your commandements of my ſervice.</p>
               <p>The very image of your countenance and outward expreſſions of your behaviour are ſutable to the vertuous reſolutions of your mind.</p>

               <p>Violence of love leads mee into this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, in which I am not ſo unfortunate as full of deſires to be more happie.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> Your imagination, when you ſpeake in ſuch high tearmes, cannot but move me to believe great improbabilities.</p>

               <p>Worthy Sir, You know your ſelfe too well, to ſuſpect me of flattery.</p>
               <p>Vertue and Eloquence are beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, to make you be amongſt men as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> I could not have the ambition to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that there could be any roome left, for

               <p>Your generous diſpoſition hath permitted me a longer audience, then your affairs could well permit.</p>
               <p>Worthy Sir, Reflect upon your crrature, with the bright beames of your generous diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>I cannot allot more moderate limits to my ambition, or wiſh my ſelf a greater hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, then to do you ſervice.</p>
               <p>Your heroicke acts ſucceeding Hiſtorians ſhall crowne with Laurels.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> There is no happineſſe on earth, but is included in your ſelfe, or in what concerns you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> Your goodneſſe doth bereave me of a voice to expreſſe your vertues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> You cannot blame me, though I hate ingratitude, ſince even beaſts are capable of acknowledgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> If you withdraw from me your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, you overthrow all the honor you have hitherto acquired for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> I ſhall fall ſicke, for want of a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to diſgeſt your favours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> Whatſoever you undertake, permit nothing to your ſpirit, which may wound your reputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> Of all men I dare free you from this crime, of violating the chaſtity of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> I owe too much honour, to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of our forepaſt acquaintance, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> For your ſake, at the ſame time I both enjoy pleaſure, and endure paine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> I muſt beg of you hereafter to have a

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> The whole Court is ſenſible of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your name to fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> I am ſo far from hiding my owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, that I acknowledge there is none ſo imperfect as my ſelfe; neither can any man arive to perfection, except he be adorned with thoſe abilities, whereof I am utterly ignorant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> I have neither power nor ability left me, but only to expreſſe, I am yours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> You have anticipated me of all Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, either of being complementall, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning you commendations for your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy favours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> Inſtead of requitall, of thoſe vowes you offer me, I am put to a ſtand, what to anſwer you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Miſtris,</hi> I deſire to paſſe my life in the pleaſing dreames of your perfections.</p>
               <p>Your Courtly voyce is like an Oracle, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to approve, or to condemne me.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Sir,</hi> I have no ſervile dependency but upon your conceptions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> In matters of Eloquence you ſeek out ſingularities, hitherto unknowne to any.</p>
               <p>From the firſt minute of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I made haſte, as I ſhall ever, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my ſelfe, your moſt humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> If you ſtill perſevere to dote thus on your beauty: the time will come, when your face will ſcare you, more than a judge doth a fellon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> I have quitted all complacency, and there is no meanes ſhall make me ſilent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faireſt,</hi> There is no part of the world ſo remote, whither my curioſity, in your ſearch ſhall not cary me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lady,</hi> The morall of my affection, is to inſtruct you to make uſe of your youth, and to gather Noſegaies, before the Roſes wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for bee confident, when you have no

further attractions, than an eloquent tongue no man will ſeeke for them in the furrowes of your face, and you ſhall onely bee left, to bewaile the ruines of your beauty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> Suffer your ſelfe to be convinced by reaſon, ſince you cannot reſiſt the ſame, but to your diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> You muſt excuſe me, ſince I know not in what manner to ſuffer ſo wounding a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> All the water in the Sea can never purifie me from this offence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lady,</hi> You have no more beauty, then wil ſerve to excuſe you from being extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ugly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> If you grant mee this favour, you ſhall elevate mee to a more ſoveraigne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, then the State of Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> It were as great a crime to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the diverſions that attend you; as not to bee acquainted with the great afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of noble company, daily repairing to viſit you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Miſtris,</hi> In my moſt ſolitary walkes it ſhall be my ambition, to preſume only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve you in my moſt ſecret cogitations.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> To returne you complements for ſuch excellent favours, were to undervalue their worth; ſince my language is too poore, and unable to lend mee wherewith to pay you.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> I intend not to commence any reall warre againſt you; for I acknowledge my choller to be artificiall, which I am ready to lay downe at your pleaſure.</p>

                     <p>PArdon me, I pray, if I preſume to ſpeake, what I have hitherto, with much affliction, hid from your knowledge.</p>
                     <p>There is a Gentleman that hath beheld your outward beauty, and by his judgement clearely diſcerned your vertues, the ornament of your mind; theſe have produc'd in him a ſtrange effect, ſo that in ſpite of his owne Reaſon, or diſſwaſion of friends, he is violently compell'd to ſpeake truth.</p>

                     <p>Doe you hold that opinion?
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:5913:52"/>
Then I will convince you by your owne argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For if it be unhappineſſe to heare truth; then I hope you will pardon me, if being compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the ſtrength of my paſſion, I doe truly tell you, that J have plac'd my affection wholly upon you, or as they commonly ſay, J doe love you.</p>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:5913:52"/>
the ſpring of naturall deſire; but I find in my ſelfe no inclination to entertaine your affection; therefore you muſt pardon me, if I deny your ſute, which I cannot grant.</hi>

                     <p>Sir, <hi>I am confident, that your affection is right and perfect, not ſeeking, under a faire and colourable pretence, to betray me: yet I cannot force my ſelfe to conſent to your motion, I being utterly ignorant in Love matters; therefore excuſe me, till time, and conſideration ſhall enforce me how to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer your deſire.</hi>

You have enough forraged the plaines of my heart, without moreover billeting there the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of deſpaire, which runnes after mee, even to the ruine of my life. Alas! I pray you doe not let thoſe Carabins of diſdaine eate up the bread of my hopes, nor beat up the bongues of my fidelity, that are ſo full of good wine of patience. I have ſo often told you, that as ſoone as the Baker of your bounty, ſhould have heated the Oven of your heart, I would ſet in the bread of my thoughts. But the bad rich man of your judgement, hath deſpiſed my poore Devill of deſire, that is going now to die in the Hoſpitall. Out alas! Gogs-nigges, what will become of the Goates of my conceits, if this wicked woman of your cruelty, pull the bed from under them of my content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

to make them ſnap at the cruſt of your Ieeres? No, I beleeve the bottle of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance once broken, you will bewaile the <hi>Orleans</hi> wine of my devotion, when you will get none elſe, but ſome tart wines of faining, which will vexe the tongue of your knowledge. But if you rid your hands of that vicious horſe of your diſtruſt, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive the reſt will not ruſh upon the <hi>Bibets</hi> of my thoughts, which hold the bridle of conſtancy. What ever befals, the Pilgrims of my deſignes, deſiring the Scollop-ſhels of your friendſhip, will be ſtill grobling in the dirt of good courage. But if the feet of my offers, take bladders of refuſall, farewell <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid's</hi> voyage. The vintages of my ſervices will be ſoone done, if the haile of your pride blaſt the grape of my purſuite. But whilſt the ſythe of your judgement, moves the graſſe of your rigours, I ſhall ever kiſſe the hands of your perfections, and make my ſelfe an everlaſting wood of the fire of your beauty.</p>
